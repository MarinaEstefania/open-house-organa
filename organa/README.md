## What's the Problem?
In Laboratoria we're looking for an efficient way to know who attended the work space daily. Up until now it's been done manually but it takes too much time.

The idea of this project is to make the attendance-taking routine easier with a web app.

The solution we propose consists of using a webcam to read [QR codes](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3digo_QR) that ideantify each student and stores that information in a databse daily.

## Why the name Organa?

Leia Organa is the resistance's general in the Star Wars universe, we like to think she takes good care of her team members!
